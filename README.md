# <Refactoring Code for Accessibility Purposes>

## Description

An increasingly important criteria for evaluating websites and their serviceability, as well as business success, is accessibility. Previous web page design left out an important segment of the population, namely individuals with disability. Excluding such users represented a loss to online businesses, and there is currently a trend to regain this group, by refactoring old code to add web accessibility.

Accessibility incorporates assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards and more, to open web page navigation to a wide range of users with different individual and group needs. Replacing non-semantic elements with semantic elements is a large part of this effort, and the focus of this project.

Previous overuse of div and span in code did not provide any meaning in terms of accessibility. Replacing them with nav, main, and section creates a better narative for people with disibility. Adding alt to images also makes the web page more fluent to these users, and pulls them into the conversation.

As part of this project, existing code was refactored to replace non-semantic elements such as div and span, with semantic elements, and to add alt to images. CSS rules were also structured and organized to eliminate duplication, and to provide a cleaner, more concise style sheet. The links from the original document were not functional, and they were updated to take the user directly to their corresponding sections.
